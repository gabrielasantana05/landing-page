<h3>Indiana</h3>
<li>2025 marked a historic season for Indiana: they achieved a conference-record number of Big Ten wins (13), something the program had never done before.Their regular season record was 23-7 overall, with 14-6 in Big Ten play.Because of this performance, Indiana earned a No. 4 seed in the 2025 NCAA Tournament — their first NCAA berth in 15 years. The 2025 team stood out for balance: multiple players earned conference honors. Senior outside hitter Candela Alonso‑Corcelles, senior opposite hitter Avry Tatum, and freshman setter Teodora Krickovic made All-Big Ten First Team — the first time the program had three First Team picks in one season.</li>
<li>2025 might represent a turning point: after decades of being underdogs, Indiana achieved unprecedented success.The growth under current head coach Steve Aird (since 2018) is evident — a rapid upward trajectory in conference wins and national exposure. The balance — experienced seniors and rising young stars — gives them a foundation that could lead to sustained competitiveness if managed well.</li>
